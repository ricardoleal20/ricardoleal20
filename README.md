# Ricardo M. Leal Lopez
## Mathematical Modeling and Simulation.

I'm a physics student at the UANL in MÃ©xico with interest in applied mathematics. I'm on my path to be a computational scientist with focus on the computational mathematics. 

Right now, I'm working with Python to do some CFD projects. Also I have worked in Data Analysis, Monte Carlo simulations and Computational methods to solve differential equations. 

Right now i'm part of a research in Nanomaterials at the departament of Physics in the UANL. I do simulations with molecular dynamics to understand the behavior of different models. I use Python to read the output data, to manipulate the structures and to do extra analysis. 

### Skills
* Numerical Analysis
* Scientific Computing
* Data Analysis
* Data visualization

### Examples of work

#### Simulation of a rocket flight solving a ODE.

  Want to know more about me?
</summary>

During my university studies, i learn how to code with FORTRAN and Python to solve scientific problems. I use FORTRAN in the courses Programming and Computational Physics. I learn how to use Python by my own to use it in Computational Nanotechnology with Aplications and Mathematical Methods for Physics. I fell in love with Python and know it's my favorite programming language, but also I'm learning Matlab and Julia.

I'm aspiring to study a graduate degree in Scientific Computing or Computational Applied Mathematics. I love programming and I love solving problems difficult to solve by hand.
I love the oportunity to simulate several real world problems, it's my passion and i can't wait to learn more and be an expert in that topics. I hope that in the future, i can use all my knowledge to help the society to be better.
